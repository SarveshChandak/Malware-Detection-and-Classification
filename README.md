# Malware Detection and Classification using Deep Learning Models

Various transfer learning models such as VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3 have been used along with many python libraries to classify malware images and identify malware families which they belong to. Malimg dataset has been used. To improve the detection of unknown malware, visual analysis has been used instead of traditional methods. This also enabled to reduce the number of false positives and false negatives.  
Achieved 98.5% accuracy in classifying malwares using InceptionResNetV2.
